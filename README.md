# Custom Alert Buttons in React assignment
This was an assignment for my Web Application Development class with the stated objective: "Create a React application with a Toolbar component that contains multiple AlertButton components. Each button should display a unique alert message when clicked, demonstrating the use of props and event handlers in React."

# On viewing the Alert Buttons in React assignment
Within your IDE, if starting from absolute scratch, navigate to where you want to install the Custom Alert Buttons assignment project and you must run "npx create-react-app alert-button-toolbar" to initialize a React application project. Then, you must enter "cd alert-button-toolbar" to change directories into the project file. 
Once there, run "npm start" to begin the application server.

Adding the AlertButton.js, Toolbar.js, and App.js from the repo to the "src" branch of the project should allow this project to run locally.
